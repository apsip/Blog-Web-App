# Blog-Web-App

This is a simple blog web application using Node.js, Express.js and EJS. The application allows the user to view blog posts, create posts, edit and delete them. The posts do not persist between sessions as there is no database used with this application. Primary purpose is to demonstrate proficient use of Node, Express and EJS.
